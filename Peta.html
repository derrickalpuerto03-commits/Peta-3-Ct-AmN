  </div>  
  <button class="toggle">Open</button>

<div class="content">  
    <h2>General Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The digestive system is responsible for converting large, complex food molecules into smaller substances that 
      the body can absorb and utilize. This process involves both mechanical digestion, which physically breaks down 
      food through actions such as chewing and churning, and chemical digestion, which uses enzymes and acids to 
      decompose complex molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into simpler forms. Digestion begins in the 
      mouth and continues through a long pathway involving several organs, each with specific functions that contribute 
      to the efficient breakdown and absorption of nutrients.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Organs and Their Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mouth – Responsible for the initial breakdown of food. Teeth perform mechanical digestion by chewing, 
        while salivary glands secrete saliva containing salivary amylase, an enzyme that begins the chemical breakdown 
        of carbohydrates. The tongue helps move food toward the esophagus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Esophagus – A muscular tube that transports swallowed food from the mouth to the stomach. Movement is achieved 
        through peristalsis, a series of wave-like muscle contractions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stomach – A muscular sac that churns food and mixes it with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and 
        the enzyme pepsin. These substances initiate the chemical digestion of proteins. The stomach also produces mucus 
        to protect its lining from acid damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Liver – Produces bile, a substance essential for emulsifying fats into smaller droplets, making them easier 
        for enzymes to digest. The liver also detoxifies harmful substances and stores nutrients such as glycogen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gallbladder – Stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. Releases bile into the small intestine when needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pancreas – Produces digestive enzymes such as lipase (for fats), trypsin (for proteins), and pancreatic amylase 
        (for carbohydrates). It also secretes bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid entering the small intestine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Small Intestine – The primary site of nutrient absorption. Contains villi and microvilli that increase surface area, 
        allowing efficient absorption of amino acids, fatty acids, glucose, vitamins, and minerals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Large Intestine – Absorbs water and electrolytes from undigested food, forming solid feces. Houses beneficial bacteria 
        that produce vitamins such as vitamin K.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digestive Enzymes</h2>
    <p>Below is a list of the major enzymes involved in digestion and the substrates they act on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Salivary Amylase – Converts starch into maltose in the mouth.</li>
      <li>Pepsin – Breaks down proteins into peptides in the stomach.</li>
      <li>Lipase – Converts fats into fatty acids and glycerol in the small intestine.</li>
      <li>Trypsin – Further digests proteins in the small intestine.</li>
      <li>Maltase, Sucrase, Lactase – Convert disaccharides into monosaccharides.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digestive Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ulcer – A sore in the stomach lining caused by acid or bacterial infection.</li>
      <li>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease – Stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.</li>
      <li>Constipation – Difficulty passing stool due to lack of fiber or dehydration.</li>
      <li>Diarrhea – Loose stool caused by infection or rapid movement of food.</li>
      <li>Lactose Intolerance – Inability to digest lactose due to lack of lactase enzyme.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="content">

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Plants have a complex internal transport system that moves water, minerals, and food to all parts of the organism. 
      Since plants lack a circulatory system similar to animals, they rely on specialized tissues and physical forces to 
      achieve movement of substances. The two primary transport tissues are the xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water 
      and minerals from the roots upward to the leaves, while phloem transports dissolved sugars and nutrients produced 
      during photosynthesis to different parts of the plant. These processes are essential for growth, survival, and reproduction.
    </p>

    <h2>Xylem Structure and Function</h2>
    <p>
      Xylem tissue consists mostly of dead, hollow cells that form long tubes. Their walls are reinforced with lignin, a tough 
      substance that helps the plant remain upright. Since the xylem cells are hollow and lack internal contents, water moves 
      easily through them. The movement of water through the xylem is primarily upward, traveling from the roots to the stems 
      and leaves.
    </p>

    <h2>Phloem Structure and Function</h2>
    <p>
      Phloem tissue consists of living cells, including sieve tube elements and companion cells. These cells transport sugars 
      produced through photosynthesis in the leaves to other growing or storage regions in the plant. Unlike xylem, which 
      operates in one direction, phloem transport is bidirectional, meaning food can move up or down depending on where it 
      is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Mechanisms of Water Movement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Root Pressure – Water absorption at the roots creates pressure that pushes water upward through the xylem. 
        This is most noticeable at night when transpiration is low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Capillary Action – Water molecules adhere to the walls of the xylem and cohere to each other, helping them climb upward.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transpiration Pull – The strongest force in water transport. When water evaporates from leaves, it creates a 
        suction force that pulls water upward from the roots.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Transpiration</h2>
    <p>
      Transpiration cools the plant, maintains water flow, transports minerals, and helps maintain the structure of plant cells. 
      Without transpiration, plants would wilt and lose the ability to transport essential nutrients.

  </div>

  <div class="content">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mendelian genetics is the foundation of modern hereditary science. Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, conducted 
      experiments on pea plants in the 1800s. Through his work, he discovered patterns in how traits are passed down 
      from parents to offspring. His findings established what are now known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. These laws 
      explain how traits remain consistent across generations and why certain traits may appear or disappear. The core idea 
      of Mendelian genetics is that traits are controlled by genes, which exist in different forms called alleles.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gene – A unit of heredity that encodes a trait. Each gene occupies a specific location (locus) on a chromosome.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allele – A variation or form of a gene. For example, alleles may code for different flower colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Genotype – The genetic makeup of an organism, represented by allele combinations such as TT, Tt, or tt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Phenotype – The physical expression of a genotype, such as tall or short plants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Homozygous – Having identical alleles for a trait (TT or tt).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heterozygous – Having different alleles for a trait (Tt).
      </li>
      <li>
        Dominant – An allele that expresses itself even if only one copy is present.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recessive – An allele that expresses itself only if two copies are present.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mendel's Laws</h2>
    <h3>Law of Dominance</h3>
    <p>
      Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive. Dominant alleles mask recessive alleles in a heterozygous pair. 
      For example, in tall (T) versus short (t) plants, T is dominant. Thus, both TT and Tt genotypes produce tall plants.
    </p>

    <h3>Law of Segregation</h3>
    <p>
      During the formation of gametes (egg or sperm cells), allele pairs separate. As a result, each gamete contains only 
      one allele for each gene. This explains why offspring can inherit recessive traits even if the parent does not show them.
    </p>

    <h3>Law of Independent Assortment</h3>
    <p>
      Genes for different traits are inherited independently of one another, provided they are located on different chromosomes. 
      This leads to genetic variation among offspring.
    </p>

    <h2>Punnett Squares</h2>
    <p>
      Punnett squares visually represent genetic crosses. They help predict possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring. 
      For example, crossing Tt with tt produces a 50 percent chance of short plants and a 50 percent chance of tall plants.

  <div class="content">

    <h2>Water Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. 
      Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers due to heat from the sun. The vapor rises into the atmosphere, 
      where it cools and condenses into clouds. Eventually, water falls back to the surface as precipitation in the form 
      of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Some of this water infiltrates the ground and becomes groundwater, while the rest 
      runs off into bodies of water. Plants also contribute through transpiration, releasing water vapor from their leaves.
    </p>

    <h2>Carbon Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The carbon cycle involves the exchange of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals. 
      Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and convert it into glucose. Animals then consume these plants 
      and use the carbon for energy and growth. Through respiration, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. 
      When organisms die, decomposers break them down, returning carbon to the soil. Carbon is also released through the 
      burning of fossil fuels.
    </p>

    <h2>Oxygen Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The oxygen cycle is closely related to the carbon cycle. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere by plants during 
      photosynthesis. Animals and humans consume this oxygen during respiration and release carbon dioxide, which plants 
      need for photosynthesis. This continuous exchange maintains balanced oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Photosynthesis is a chemical process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy from the sun into
      chemical energy stored in glucose. This process does not simply produce food for the plant; it also releases oxygen into
      the atmosphere, making it vital for the survival of nearly all living things. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts,
      specialized organelles found mostly in the cells of plant leaves.
    </p>

    <h2>Photosynthesis Equation (Balanced)</h2>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide + Water + Light → Glucose + Oxygen  
      6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + Light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂  
      This equation represents the conversion of inorganic molecules (CO₂ and H₂O) into an organic molecule (glucose).
    </p>

    <h2>Chloroplast Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Thylakoids – Flattened membrane sacs containing chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for absorbing sunlight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grana – Stacks of thylakoids that increase the surface area for light absorption.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stroma – Fluid-filled space where the Calvin cycle occurs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chlorophyll – The green pigment that captures light energy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stage 1: Light-Dependent Reactions</h2>
    <p>
      These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and require direct sunlight. The main purpose is to convert light energy
      into ATP and NADPH, which are energy
